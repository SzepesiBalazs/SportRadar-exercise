Use of AI in My Work

In my development process, I integrated AI tools such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT to enhance efficiency and code quality.

Environment Setup:
I configured a local environment where the server and frontend could communicate. Although this setup involved some DevOps work, I kept it minimal to focus on the core functionality.

Code Assistance and Refactoring:
AI provided real-time code suggestions with co-pilot which helped identify cleaner, more maintainable solutions during refactoring. For instance, while I could have implemented certain logic differently, AI-assisted alternatives led to more efficient and readable code.

Backend and API Understanding:
I used AI to strengthen my understanding of server-side concepts, API structure, and database integration. It supported me in applying my knowledge of how APIs function, how data is imported into databases, and how connections are managed effectively.

Concept Implementation:
When working with concepts such as DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), AI helped me refine my implementation based on best practices, aligning with what I already understood conceptually.

Frontend Styling:
To optimize time and maintain consistency, I used AI assistance when working with Tailwind CSS, enabling faster iteration and cleaner design adjustments.

Research and Information Gathering:
AI was also valuable for quickly collecting relevant technical information, ensuring that implementation decisions were well-informed and up to date.
